    <h1>Sahithi Kasarapu snips a play</h1>
    <h4>TRADITION _George Middleton_ </h4>
            <p>The table, knocks the ashes carefully from his pipe into his hand,
             and throws them behind the screen; takes off his spectacles and
             wipes them as he, too, looks over toward his daughter, still gazing
             absently into the garden. Finally, after a slight hesitation, he
             goes to her and puts his arm about her; she is startled but smiles
             sweetly._</p>
        <p>OLLIVANT. [_Affectionately._] Glad to be home again, Mary?</p>
        <p>MARY. [_Evasively._] The garden is so pretty.</p>
        <p>OLLIVANT. Hasn't changed much, eh?</p>
        <p>MARY. It seems different; perhaps it's the night.</p>

        mother there so often this spring.</p>
        <p>EMILY. [_Quietly._] This dry spell is not good for flowers.</p>
        <p>OLLIVANT. It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
        thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
        hill. [_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.] Is there any of that spray
        mixture left, Emily, dear?</p>
